For this project, we will act as a fintech engineer and lead developer on a decentralized finance team. My goal is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger will allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
In order to create our blockchain and shared ledger, I will be using Python to create new data class for a Block, Record and a Pychain. I will also add the proof of work logic along with the difficuly that can be modified by the user.


Our code will be publiished through StreamLit to verify the block contents and hashes in the built-in dropdown menu. 

Lastl, we will test the blockchain validation process by using the web interface as shown in the screenshot below.
